	<h1>Welcome to HaikuPorts</h1>
	<p>HaikuPorts is a centralized collection of software ported to the <a href="http://www.haiku-os.org">Haiku</a> platform. The main goal of this site is to facilitate cooperation towards porting efforts.</p>
	<h1>The HaikuPorter</h1>
	<p>The <a href="http://github.com/haikuports/haikuporter">HaikuPorter</a> tool is provided to ease the fetching, patching and building of source code.
	It can be compared to a slim version of <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/about.xml">Gentoo Portage</a>. Each port contains the Haiku-specific
	patches to the original source code. It fetches the original source code, applies the Haiku-specific patches, builds, and packages the port in a format
	suitable for Haiku's package manager.</p>
	<h1>Get started</h1>
	<p>The entry point for working with haikuporter and the ports is the <a href="https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/wiki">haiku ports wiki</a>.
	Additional support is available through the <a href="https://github.com/haikuports/haikuports/wiki/MailingList">mailing list</a>.</p>
